# Slingshot_Prototype

This is a basic prototype showcasing the slingshot mechanism, you have to touch and drag the object and release your finger to shoot the object opposite to the swipe direction to hit the target. 
Two scripts are used in this project form which the "BaseScript" is locating the target randomly and the "Shoot" script is inheriting the "BaseScript" and implementing the logic of the game logic.
